This is a resume parser project that extracts information from resumes in various formats and converts them into structured data. The parser uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the content of resumes and identify key information such as contact details, education history, work experience, and skills.

## Features

- Supports parsing resumes in multiple formats such as PDF, Word documents, and plain text files.
- Extracts contact information including name, email address, phone number, and location.
- Identifies education details such as degree, university, and graduation year.
- Parses work experience information including job titles, companies, dates, and job descriptions.
- Recognizes skills and keywords relevant to specific industries or job positions.

Usage
